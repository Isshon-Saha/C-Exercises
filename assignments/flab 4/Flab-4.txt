1. Write an application to gracefully conduct with the following loop:

   for(int i=5;i>-4;i--)
	cout<<22/i<<endl;

   where we want to avoid an error caused by "devide by zero".


2.  Write an application where the user inputs a sring. if the string is 0 lengthor if it has a length greater than 10, then an exception will be called. Under any circumstance the application should output a string where 10>length>0.

3. Your application has an array of size 10. It is filled with user entered inputs.
   the user inputs data in an infinite loop. if the input exceeds the size of the array
   the an exception is thrown.

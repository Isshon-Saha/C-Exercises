Assume that a bank maintains two kinds of accounts for customers, one called savings account and the other as current account. 
- The savings account provides compound interest rate and withdrawal facilities but no cheque book facilty. 
- The current account provides cheque book facilty but no interest. Current account holders should also maintain a minimum balance and if the balance falls below this level, a service charge is imposed.

Create a class account that stores customer name, account number, type of account. From this derive the classes cur_acct and sav_acct to make them more specific for their requirements. Include required member functions to achieve the following tasks:

a.  account deposit from a customer and update the balance
b.  display the balance
c.  compute and deposit interest
d.  permit withdrawal and update balance
e.  check for the minimum balance,impose penalty,if necessary and update the balance

do not use any constructors. Use member functions to initialize class members.
